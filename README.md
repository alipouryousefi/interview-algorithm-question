Algorithm Interview Questions

This repository contains a collection of algorithm questions commonly asked during technical interviews. The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for developers preparing for coding interviews, helping them practice and improve their problem-solving skills.


Introduction

Algorithm questions are an essential part of technical interviews, and they assess a candidate's ability to solve complex problems, think critically, and write efficient code. This repository aims to cover a wide range of algorithmic topics and difficulty levels, allowing developers to practice different types of problems.

Each algorithm question includes a detailed problem statement and examples to understand the input and expected output. Solutions are also provided in various programming languages to help users compare and learn different approaches.
